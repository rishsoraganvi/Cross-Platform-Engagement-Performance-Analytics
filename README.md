# Cross-Platform Social Media Engagement Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains an Alternate Assessment Tool (AAT) submission for the Data Science & Analytics course (23AM3510). The project analyzes social media engagement metrics to identify optimal posting strategies across different platforms.

## Problem Statement
Analyze engagement metrics across multiple social media platforms to determine:
- Best performing platforms.
- Impact of content types (Image vs Video vs Text).
- Optimal posting times and days.

## Repository Structure
- **/data**: Contains raw and processed CSV datasets.
- **/tableau_workbooks**: Contains the `.twbx` solution file.
- **/screenshots**: Images of the final dashboard and insights.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau Desktop**: For data visualization and dashboarding.
- **Python (Pandas)**: For data preprocessing (deriving content types and time extraction).

## Key Insights
1. **Top Platform**: [Mention the platform with highest bar in Viz 1] had the highest engagement rate.
2. **Best Content Type**: [Video/Image/Text] performed best, driven primarily by [Platform Name].
3. **Optimal Timing**: Engagement peaks around [Hour] on [Day of Week].

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `.twbx` file in the `/tableau_workbooks` folder using Tableau Desktop.
3. The data source is linked relatively to the `/data` folder.
